# **Intro**

Welcome to "Miles and Smiles"! This is more than just an app - it's a bridge to unite hearts separated by distance. If you're in a long-distance relationship, you know how challenging it can be to maintain connection and intimacy. That's why we created "Miles and Smiles", a tool designed especially for couples who want to feel closer, regardless of the distance that separates them. With intuitive and user-friendly features, we're here to turn every mile traveled into shared smiles. Explore all that "Miles and Smiles" has to offer and embark on this journey of long-distance love with confidence and joy.

#### Site-goals 
* Provide a system to allow users to see a countdown based on their planned meeting date and their geo-location.
* Allow users to create a profile to enter relationship details.
* Responsive application, based on Hackathon judging criteria, where a CSS framework is used and Valentine's day is the theme .

#### Agile Methodology
The project was developed by using agile methodologies. The development cycle was divided into short sprints, where code was delivered in small chunks for flexibility and good coding practice.
Furthermore, the branch system and forking was used to simulate a real-world developer team environment.

The Kanban board was created to keep track of project progression and issues assessment. Issues were given acceptance criteria and were split into tasks if feasible.


## The Scope Plane
* Responsive design - website should support devices from 320px up
* Hamburger menu for mobile devices
* Interactive World Map with minimally invasive information details about couples relationships
* Shopping cart for users that want to buy gifts

#### Target Audience
The target audience for "Miles and Smiles" is couples who are in long-distance relationships. This includes people of all ages who are separated by significant distances due to reasons such as work, studies or other circumstances. These couples are looking for ways to maintain a close connection, despite the physical distance, and are interested in tools that help them overcome the unique challenges faced in long-distance relationships. The app is especially suitable for those who want to feel closer to their partners, sharing special moments, planning future meetings and creating memories together, regardless of the distance that separates them.

## **Deployment**
### Deployment Steps
- Install Git and the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) on your local machine if you haven't already.
- Navigate to your project's root directory using the command line.
- Initialize a local Git repository and commit your application code to it:

    $ cd example-app
    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "My first commit"

    Created initial commit 5df2d09: My first commit
    44 files changed, 8393 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 README
    create mode 100644 Procfile
    create mode 100644 app/controllers/source_file

- Create a new Heroku app with the heroku create command (use -a to specify an app name):

    $ heroku create -a example-app
    Creating app... done, â¬¢ example-app

- Verify the Heroku remote has been set for your local repository:

    $ git remote -v

- Deploy your app to Heroku using the git push heroku main command (or git push heroku <branch-name>:main for a non-main branch):

    $ git push heroku main
    Initializing repository, done.
    updating 'refs/heads/main'

- You can confirm the deployment by running heroku ps:scale web=1 and heroku open.
